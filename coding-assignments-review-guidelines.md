# Coding Assignments Review Guidelines (Do's & Dont's)

### ðŸŸ¢ Do Comment On
* **Wrong functionality**: Is the code actually doing what was requested in the requirements?
* **Improper naming:** variables, functions, classes, constants - Should conform to the [PEP8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
* **Code duplication:** If you see duplication, offer to extract to a function
* **Long Functions:** Functions longer than 5-7 lines should be suspicously reviewed:
    *  Does the functions does to much work
    *  Is naming of the function implies it does more than 1 single thing? 
* **Comments:**  - unless there is a very good reason for it. Offer the student to improve the naming of the function/class/variable/constant instead.
* **Useless `print()` statements:** usually used for debugging purposes. should be removed.
* **Unreadable code:** When code is too complex to read & understand. try to offer a simpler solution. Maybe exraction of code.
* **Not using libraries:**: A comlpex implementation instead of using a Builtin or popular library.
* **Excessive use of libraries:** instead of actually implementing a more simple solution.


### ðŸŸ¥ Avoid Commenting On

* Perfomance/optimization/efficiency of code
* Design patterns
* Object oriented programming or functional programming styles. Maybe more towards the end of the course
* Avoid offering advanced use of the language such as classes,comprehensions and lambdas (Unless the student shows signs of some more advanced programming and have implemented by him/her self)
